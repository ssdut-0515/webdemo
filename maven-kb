Question:
Maven not able to download dependency

Answer:
1. After a failed attempt, maven will leave a small file in your local .m2 repository that will prevent any attempt to re-download the file unless the update interval has elapsed or you force the updates using the maven -U switch described in other answers.
Just delete the folder for that artifact in your local m2 repository and update you project; a new download attempt will trigger.
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/caucho/hessian/3.1.5

2.Open a command prompt, go to your project directory and run: mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true

The eclipse:eclipse portion will regenerate your project files etc, the last 2 properties are more for convenience but I like downloading the sources and javadoc.
